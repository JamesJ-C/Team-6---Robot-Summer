# Team-6---Robot-Summer


Tasks to do:

PID control of rod with limit switches (needed for:)
    Elevator system movement
    Plate serving movement
    rack and pinion 
    Lazy susan rotation code (the same type of abstraction. I think identical code as above)


Claw servo integration with limit switches

drive PID tuning
    find better suited motors


Determine communcation data structure & what information to send

PID tuning for IR beacon sensor

start to combine code components
